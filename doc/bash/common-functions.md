# Common Functions

Defines functions for:

* [path manipulation](./path.md)


## Usage

Common functions are loaded by default via Bash profiles and `rc` files,
so sourcing the common functions is generally unnecessary.

```bash
source "${COMMON_FUNCTIONS_FILE:-/usr/local/1121citrus/include/bash/common-functions}"
```
